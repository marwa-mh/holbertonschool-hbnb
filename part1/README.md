## üìå Project Overview

**HBnB** is a simplified full-stack clone of Airbnb, designed as a group project for Holberton School.
It allows users to:
- Sign up or log in (combined authentication flow).
- Search and filter places by categories and keywords.
- View place details, leave reviews, and explore amenities.

The project follows an **MVC architecture** (Model-View-Controller), which separates the application into three core components:

- **Model**: The Model handles the application's data and logic. It's responsible for interacting with the database, managing data, and processing business rules.
- **View** (Presentation Layer): The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user. It's the user interface that displays information in a user-friendly format.
- **Controller**: Acts as the bridge between the View and the Model, processing incoming requests, applying logic, and returning appropriate responses.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The app is divided into three layers:

### üîπ Presentation Layer (Frontend)

* Search interface, room details, profile management
* Routes like `/rooms/:id`, `/signup_login`, `/become-a-host`

### üî∏ Business Logic Layer (Controllers/Services)

* Validates data
* Handles permissions, authentication, and validation
* Routes interact with models and services

### üîª Persistence Layer (Database)

* Relational tables (e.g., Place, User, Reservation, Review)
* Optionally uses NoSQL for storing JSON fields (like photos or user preferences)
